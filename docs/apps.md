## Overview
In general, the tools at openDendro are meant to be used in a scripting environment. However, some tasks are better done interactively. With that in mind, there are currently two apps in development. 

* xDateR` is a Shiny app for graphically and statistically crossdating tree-ring data
* iDetrend is a Shiny app for interactively detrending tree-ring data
