The [dplR](https://github.com/AndyBunn/dplR) library is hosted on CRAN and can be run in RStudio and RStudio-Server (in browser).

## Introduction
The `R` language and programming environment is now commonly used in dendrochronology. `R` is the world's  preeminent open-source statistical computing software and its power can be harnessed for tree-ring science through the contribution of add-on packages which are freely available on the internet. The R version of `openDendro`'s codebase is contained in the package `dplR`.

## Installation

### R
Install `R` by visiting [www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/). 
We recommend that you use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to interact with, and script in `R`.

### Basic installation
New users can install `dplR` using `install.packages()` via 
```
install.packages("dplR", dependencies=TRUE)
library(dplR)
```

### Development install
The, possibly unstable, development version of  `dplR` can be installed directly from GitHub.

```
devtools::install_github("andybunn/dplR")
```

## Getting Started

New users of dplR can begin by working with the introductory chapters in [Learning to Love dplR](https://opendendro.github.io/dplR-workshop/) which contains instructional material for using `dplR`.
